### Initially a companion piece to:

Todd McLeods' course "Learn How To Code: Google's Go (golang) Programming Language" on Udemy.
It has the three repos attached to the course already added.
An alternative to installing Go locally or using the Go playground.

Just clone and run `docker-compose up --build`
You can exec into the container to view any of the course repos.
Vim-tiny is installed so you can work entirely from within the container and the command line.

It has a simple webserver so if you're like me and come from a web background, you can work in the browser, or from the terminal, just change the code in `main.go`.
